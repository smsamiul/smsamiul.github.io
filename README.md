# Personal Research Website (Free Hosting)

This is a **free**, no-purchase-needed personal website you can deploy on **GitHub Pages** or **Netlify**.

## Quick Edit
- Open `index.html` and replace **Your Name**, email, links, and section contents.
- Put your actual `CV.pdf` into `assets/` and keep the link as `assets/CV.pdf`.
- Update publications in the table under the “Publications” section.

## Deploy to GitHub Pages (100% free)
1. Create a GitHub account (if you don’t have one).
2. Create a new repository named `username.github.io` (replace `username` with your GitHub username).
3. Upload all files in this folder to the repository (index.html, styles.css, script.js, assets/).
4. Go to **Settings → Pages** and ensure the site is built from the `main` branch (root).
5. Visit `https://username.github.io` — your site is live.

### Alternative: Repo not named username.github.io
- Create any repo name, e.g., `personal-site`.
- Go to **Settings → Pages**, set Source = `main` and Folder = `/root`.
- Site will be at `https://username.github.io/personal-site/`.

## Deploy to Netlify (free)
1. Go to https://app.netlify.com and click **Add new site → Deploy manually**.
2. Drag & drop this folder. Netlify gives you a live URL immediately.
3. Click **Site settings → Domain management** to set a custom subdomain (still free).

## Optional free extras
- **Custom domain (optional cost)**: You can keep it 100% free without a domain by using the default GitHub/Netlify URL.
- **Analytics**: Add Plausible/Matomo script for privacy-friendly stats (free tiers available).
- **Form**: Use Formspree/Basin for a no-backend contact form.

## Editing Tips
- Keep it simple and fast; it’s pure HTML/CSS with a small JS for publication search.
- Replace placeholder text and badges with your research areas.
- Add new sections as needed (e.g., “Grants”, “News”, “Students”).
